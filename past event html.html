			  <h4 class="text-center">Introduction</h4>
				<p>This trip to New York truly changed my life. As I get older I become more and more thankful for the memories I've shared with my father, and family. Overall I had a great time and I'm excited to share this experience with you!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
				<h4 class="text-center">New York&nbsp;</h4>
				<p><em>To give an overview, when I was around 15 years old, me and my family went on a vacation to New York City. The details will be available below!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </em></p>

				<h4 class="text-center">Entering New York&nbsp;</h4>
			  <p>When we began to get closer and closer to New York, I could see the buildings of the city reveal themselves. As someone who’s lived in a small town with a population of under 1,000 people my whole life (at the time), seeing the city was a huge moment in my life. I remember seeing big cities in photos and movies; however, I had never truly experienced it firsthand. It was also my dads first time seeing NYC, and it was a special moment we got to share. </p>
			  <p>&nbsp;When we got settled into our hotel (which was also stunning) we finally got to start our vacation off. One of the first things we did was got some food somewhere that sixteen-year-old me had been very excited for. It was Mc Gees bar and grill, which is the bar that “How I Met Your Mother” was based off or at least the bar they went to. At the time “How I Met Your Mother” was one of our favorite shows and getting to experience it in person was very cool, and of course the food was great</p>
			  <p> <strong><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some things we did:&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
			  <p>Our next destination was a Broadway show to see “The lion king”, which was incredible. We got great seats near the middle, and I remember getting a cool souvenir cup which I still have today. I also remember sitting next to my cousin Nolan, the whole time we were in awe by the quality of the show, and I will never forget it. We then got to see the statue of liberty, as well as the empire state building, which were both a very cool experience. When I saw the statue of liberty in person, I thought it looked smaller than it would have from the pictures, however, it was still a very cool experience. Overall, this trip truly changed my life. Being able to experience the culture of a city with my family will be something I am forever grateful for. Now that Mc Gees bar and grill, the statue of liberty and a Broadway show are scratched off my bucket list, I can’t wait for the adventures to come in the future. &nbsp;</p>
