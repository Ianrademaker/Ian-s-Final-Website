		  <p>I‚Äôve heard those words far too often in my life. ‚ÄúStop being lazy‚Äù or ‚Äúyou play that game too much‚Äù. The idea that video games made me a lazy person had always fascinated me, because to me it was the exact opposite. Video games have taught me a lot about working hard to reach a goal, working on a team, communication skills, and much more. One thing I‚Äôll make clear is there are limits to this, and in some cases gaming can become problematic which will be discussed later.</p> 

<p>Over the past decade, gaming has completely exploded due to many reasons such as covid, technological growth, cheaper and more accessible gaming devices and much more. Considering this, I always find it humorous when someone says something like ‚Äúall these new games have made for a lazy society‚Äù or anything of that nature. I always think back to the television, and how when someone watches TV, they are essentially just doing what gamers do without thinking about it. The key takeaway there is ‚Äúwithout thinking about it‚Äù, considering both are staring at a screen of some sort. The only difference is with video games there tends to be a task at hand, goals to work toward etc. Not to mention the fact that people are creating successful careers using gaming, however that's a whole different conversation. 
</p>
				<p>During my research, I came across three main ideas/ quotes that supported my claim to some of the benefits of gaming. ‚óè <em>‚ÄúThe research team, headed by Professor of Psychology Linda Jackson, also found that the level of creativity was not enhanced by general computer or internet use (i.e. activities excluding gaming). These findings suggest a specific connection between computer game playing and creativity, which were also resistant to gender, race, and even the types of games the children played.‚Äù[1]</em> ‚óè<em> "Team video gaming may truly be a viable‚Äîand perhaps even optimal‚Äîalternative for team building," said lead researcher Mark Keith, associate professor of information systems at BYU.‚Äù [2]</em> ‚óè <em>‚ÄúIn our own lives we often overlook these mindsets by wanting to be done quickly and perfectly on our first try. Instead, applying our behaviors from playing video games to checking off to-do lists, can be a beneficial way to set ourselves up for success.‚Äù [3]</em></p>
</div>
	    <div class="col-lg-8 pt-3">
				<h4><em>&nbsp;Gaming and its benefits in the workplace</em></h4>
		  <p><em>&quot;Of the three ideas/ quotes listed, I wanted to narrow it down to the study that I found linking video games and workplace productivity/ communication. The study essentially shows us that videogames are a great way to get people in a workplace talking and working together, even if they hadn‚Äôt already been very acquainted with one another.[2] Playing games together allowed for these individuals to talk, and work together to accomplish whatever task the game brought to them.The beauty of this is that you can get two people who don‚Äôt know each other to work together and communicate as if they‚Äôd known each other their entire lives, and this tactic can be used in so many different cases the possibilities are endless.[2] Something that can be seen as a distraction, can also be seen as an opportunity for improvement. If workplaces got all of their co- workers together and let them play different games of their choice(s), that could potentially lead to those workers creating better relationships that in the long run, could lead to an overall better workplace. </em></p>

				<h4 class="text-center">Other benefits:&nbsp;</h4>
				<p class="stone">To finalize, I'd like to discuss some of the major benefits of gaming that I have found in today‚Äôs world. First and foremost, I‚Äôd like to discuss the career options that gaming has set on the table for us. This is something that I believe is harder for the older generations to understand, which may play a role in why gaming may sometimes get a bad rep. In terms of career options in gaming, the possibilities are endless. You can now stream games, coach others in games, develop games, test games, compete competitively for prize money in games and much more. There are professional ‚Äúmajor league gaming‚Äù teams as well as college level teams. There‚Äôs a huge amount of opportunity in gaming and to think that people are making millions playing their favorite video game is amazing. To tie this back to my conclusion, I feel that the opportunities for success in gaming is enough to justify why so many people love it and find it so appealing. In addition to this, I believe anyone who is making money off of what they love is doing something right!

I also found that gaming has many benefits to mental health when used correctly. ‚ÄúGaming, when used positively, can be a really helpful way to look after your mental health. This is because it can give us a space to unwind, relax and take time out from the pressures of daily life ‚Äì just like reading can, or going for a walk. It can give us a sense of achievement and help us learn new skills, like problem-solving. Gaming can also be a really sociable way to have fun and stay connected with friends and family.‚Äù [4] The point I found the most relatable was the part regarding staying connected with friends and family. Individuals who move away for college, work, etc., can still stay in touch and talk frequently through video games. I get the privilege of getting to play xbox with my friends who live hours away and that allows us to talk, laugh, and stay in touch even though we live far away from each other at this point in our lives. [4] The benefit that things like this have on our mental health can be huge and it is important to remember how much of an impact small things can have on mental health. In addition to this, the fact that we can do all this while enjoying a game is amazing and modern technology is absolutely to thank for all of it.

		</div>
		  
		  <div class="col-lg-12 pt-3">
				<p>After all, I have concluded that my opinion did not change, and I still feel as strongly as I ever had about the benefits of gaming. I completely disagree with the narrative that gaming has created a lazy society and I feel that if anything, gaming has birthed a whole new world of potential and success for many individuals to come. It is time for us as a society to accept and understand that we are living in an age of technology, and I believe that the best thing we can do is adapt to it and use it to our advantage as much as possible.
