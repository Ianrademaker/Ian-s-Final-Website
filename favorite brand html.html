			<h4>Which Brand?</h4>
			  <p>My favorite brand would have to be Xbox. Xbox is a video game brand which was created by Microsoft. There are many reasons why Xbox is my favorite brand, and why it will be the aesthetic motivation for my website. For starters, Xbox is a brand that has fed me hours upon hours of entertainment, friendship, and overall happiness. In terms of aesthetic inspiration, I have always loved the aesthetic of Xbox’s brand/ website. They primarily use three main colors which include, white, black and a “Xbox” green. I love the way these colors pop and they work together great in my opinion. In addition to this Xbox’s website puts the main new/ popular games in the front creating easy navigation for most individuals coming to check out what’s new. </p>

				<h4>Why Xbox?</h4>
			  <p>Xbox’s website has very simple, yet effective navigation. This is one reasoI love their branding.&nbsp; &nbsp; There’s essentially the home screen which lists many different new releases as well as a “main hub” toward the top of the list with ways to navigate throughout the website. There’s a game pass tab, games tab, consoles tab etc. which allow you to easily navigate throughout the website. All of which is in their iconic color scheme and very simple font choices. The fonts are primarily black or white, however there some areas on the website the font is green which typically isn’t the case for headers or body text. </p>
				<p>In terms of why I love the brand in general, thats easy. I grew up loving Xbox and the hapiness and entertainment it has brought me is priceless.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          </div>
			<div class="col-lg-6 pt-3">
				<h4>What do I Plan to Use?</h4>
				<p>Overall, I like the fonts as well as the colors used on the Xbox website. For the time being, I plan to use a font very similar to if not the same as their website. I may change up the color scheme a bit, however I plan to keep the general theme the same and use green and white as my drivers. I think the green background with white text works well and I currently plan to capitalize on that idea. In terms of my logo header, I plan to take the white background and add green text in the bold Xbox style font, however I am open for new ideas on this because I’m not sure how it will look once its created. </p>

			<h4>My Logo Header</h4>
			  <p>I want to find something that is “arcade retro” style. I love the color purple so I'd like for that to fit in somewhere in the midst of the green.&nbsp; &nbsp;I feel this style will pair well with the green and white accent of my website. My overall goal is to create a retro feel to the website while maintaining a clean and aesthetically pleasing look. As stated prior I’m not fully sure on what direction I want to go with my header in terms of color choices. As of right now I feel I’ll go with an “Xbox green”, white, or black. With green my white text will pop and I’m hoping they contrast each other to make the text pop. I will also consider using a grey in some areas of the website how the Xbox website does. I feel this can be beneficial to set certain tabs aside from the rest of the website and give them their own feel. Overall most of my website will take a lot of inspiration from Microsoft’s Xbox site, with a few tweaks here and there to make it my own. </p>
